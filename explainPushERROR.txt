! [rejected]        mike -> mike (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/mburn9506-bot/my-first-repo.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

answer:
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/mike --oneline
(This shows which commits exist remotely but not in your local branch.)
===============================================

option1:
git pull origin mike --rebase
then push:
git push origin mike
git pull --rebase pulls new commits from the remote and replays your local commits on top.

Then you can push normally once everything is in sync.
===================================
option2:If you want to overwrite remote changes

This will overwrite the remote branch with your local one — any commits on GitHub that you don’t have locally will be deleted from that branch.
Quick check before pushing

You can see what’s different using:
Quick check before pushing
git fetch origin
git log HEAD..origin/mike --oneline
This shows which commits exist remotely but not in your local branch.
